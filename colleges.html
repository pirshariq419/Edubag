      <br>
      <p><strong>About </strong>: The establishment of agricultural university under the name Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology was passed by the State Legislature in the 33rd year of the Republic of India on 31st of March, 1982 which came into force on 1st of August,1982 with its jurisdiction over the entire State of Jammu and Kashmir and headquarter at Shalimar, Srinagar. With the establishment of Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology (SKUAST), agricultural education, research and extension training units were transferred to SKUAST from various development departments of Jammu and Kashmir State viz. agriculture, animal husbandry, sheep husbandry and sericulture. The university operates on the Land Grant College concept of USA following the Model Act of SAUs evolved by ICAR. It is a multi-campus University.It is a matter of great satisfaction that extremely incoherent and stagnated research infrastructure, an initial customary educational base and non-existent extension education services have given way to an organized institution of SKUAST, which has taken over responsibility of supporting the state in its effort to develop agricultural economy in agriculture and allied sectors. There is no doubt that SKUAST has grown faster than many other agricultural universities of the country. In the year 1998-99, the territorial jurisdiction of the University was redefined by amending the SKUAST Act 1982 under which a separate agriculture university was established for Jammu Division and named as Sher-e- Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology of Jammu(SKUAST-J).</p>

      <h4 class="styled-title"><strong>3. Sri Pratap College</strong></h4>
      <br>
      <p><strong>About </strong>: Sri Pratap College, the oldest and premier institute of higher education in Kashmir embodies a history of one hundred and nineteen years of its glorious past. It was established in the year 1905 as an intermediate college through the upgradation of the famous Hindu High School, Srinagar. Through the personal effort of the noted British social reformer and educationist, Dr. Annie Besant, the Central Hindu College Trust, Benares (to which the college was affiliated) was directed to appoint Mr M.U. Moore, a noted Irish scholar as the first principal of the institution. Starting with a modest roll of eight students and only six teachers on its staff, in a few years’ time, the college rose to the Degree level in Arts and by 1911, the state government took it over and renamed it Sri Pratap College after the name of the then ruler of the State, Maharaja Pratap Singh. In 1912, the college got affiliated with the Punjab University, Lahore and its growth was fostered by the remarkable patronage from the State government during its very nascent days. Ever since, the development of the college has been a steady process persisting through the entire span of the 20th century.
        During the tenure of Prof. I. K. Sharga (1911-1921), the science stream up to the intermediate level was introduced in the college curriculum. The dynamic and resourceful academicians and administrators like Prof M.U. Moore, Prof Vinamali Chakarvati, Prof Jia Lal Kaul and Prof Saif-ud-din have served the college and contributed to its development immensely. The diligence and sincerity of the administration and faculty is evidenced in the successful careers of hundreds of the college alumni who rose to eminence in different professions and occupied important positions in the state administration.
        The history of S.P. College is, in fact, the history of progress of higher education in Kashmir. For about the first half of the 20th century, S.P. College had the distinction of being the only institution to provide facilities for imparting higher education in Arts and Science disciplines in the valley. Despite a good number of colleges coming into existence in the valley after 1947, the college continued to maintain its primacy and academic excellence.</p>

      <h4 class="styled-title"><strong>5. SKAUST Kashmir</strong></h4>
      <br>
      <p><strong>About </strong>: The establishment of agricultural university under the name Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology was passed by the State Legislature in the 33rd year of the Republic of India on 31st of March, 1982 which came into force on 1st of August,1982 with its jurisdiction over the entire State of Jammu and Kashmir and headquarter at Shalimar, Srinagar. With the establishment of Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology (SKUAST), agricultural education, research and extension training units were transferred to SKUAST from various development departments of Jammu and Kashmir State viz. agriculture, animal husbandry, sheep husbandry and sericulture. The university operates on the Land Grant College concept of USA following the Model Act of SAUs evolved by ICAR. It is a multi-campus University.It is a matter of great satisfaction that extremely incoherent and stagnated research infrastructure, an initial customary educational base and non-existent extension education services have given way to an organized institution of SKUAST, which has taken over responsibility of supporting the state in its effort to develop agricultural economy in agriculture and allied sectors. There is no doubt that SKUAST has grown faster than many other agricultural universities of the country. In the year 1998-99, the territorial jurisdiction of the University was redefined by amending the SKUAST Act 1982 under which a separate agriculture university was established for Jammu Division and named as Sher-e- Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology of Jammu(SKUAST-J).</p>
